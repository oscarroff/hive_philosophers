philosophers project for Hive, Helsinki

The classic philosophers problem! A given number of philosophers sit around a circular table. The same number of forks are on the table, one fork between each pair of philosophers. In order to eat they need to pick up two forks (it's obviously something very tricky to eat, I'm going to hazzard a guess at one of those Master Chef sculpture-like desserts), which means that the neighbouring two philosophers cannot eat simultaneously. All philosophers eat, sleep and think for a give amount of time. While eating, they cannot sleep or think. While sleeping, they cannot eat or think. And of course, while thinking, they cannot eat or sleep. If a philosopher has not started eating in a given amount of time since starting their last meal then they die, at which point the simulation ends for all philosophers. An optional extra argument can be provided for the number of times a philosopher needs to eat before it is fed, and it no longer needs to complete tasks. If all philosophers are fed then the simulation also ends.
